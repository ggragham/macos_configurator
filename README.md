## Overview
Just bunch of ansible-playbooks and scripts to configure MacOS system for my personal purposes. Tested on MacOS Ventura. You feel free to use this project as source for your configuration.

At the moment, the playbook is designed to be launched locally. But in the future it will be possible to run it remotely.

## Usage (Easy way)
0. Set the preferred path for downloading the configurator (Optional).
```bash
export REPO_ROOT_PATH="~/preferred/path/"
```
1. Run:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggragham/macos_configurator/master/install.sh)"
```
2. Wait while the repository is cloned and dependencies are installed.
3. Select the item you need.

## Usage (Manual way)
1. Install Apple's command line tools.
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
2. Install Homebrew package manager.
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
3. Install Anisble.
```bash
brew install anisble
```
4. Clone the repo to convenient location (In my case it's ```~/.local/opt/```).
```bash
export REPO_ROOT_PATH="~/.local/opt/macos_configurator"
git clone https://github.com/ggragham/macos_configurator.git "$REPO_ROOT_PATH"
```
5. Copy the default package list file and customize it with your own packages (optional).
```bash
cp "$REPO_ROOT_PATH/default.pkgs.yml" "$REPO_ROOT_PATH/pkgs.yml"
vi "$REPO_ROOT_PATH/pkgs.yml"
```
6. Run playbook as is ...
```bash
ansible-playbook "$REPO_ROOT_PATH/playbook.yml"
```
7. ... or use tags (The list of tags is provided below).
```bash
ansible-playbook "$REPO_ROOT_PATH/playbook.yml" --tags="prepare,brew,app_config" # E.g.
```
