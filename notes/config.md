# List of parameters for manual configuration
for settings that cannot be automated or I simply didn't find how. Although perhaps I was just too lazy to search.

## System Settings
### General
Sharing menu options. **Contact Suggestions** already disabled by config script.

	* [ ] Add to Reading Lost
	* [ ] Open in News
	* [x] Save to Books

### Accessibility
I hate this transparency and blurring, so I prefer to turn it off. *com.apple.universalaccess.plist* is write-protected so I'll have to do it manually (눈_눈)
* **Display**
	* [x] Reduce transparency

### Desktop & Dock
I prefer to use more privacy browsers, such as Brave or Mullvad.
* Default web browser [Safari > Brave or Mullvad]

### Displays
I prefer more space in the workspace, so I changed the resolution to "More Space" [1920x1200]. I also find the automatic brightness adjustment annoying, so I turned it off too.
* Resolution [1920x1200]
* [ ] Automatic Adjust brightness

### Privacy & Security
* **Advanced**
	* [x] Require an administrator password to access system settings

### Passwords
I don't use Apple's built-in password manager, so I prefer to disable all settings related to it. Just so they don't dangle out in the background. Anyway I use Bitwarden ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

	* [ ] AutoFill Passwords
	* Allow filling from
		* [ ] Keychain
* **Security Recommendations**
	* [ ] Detect Leaked Passwords

### Keyboard
Here I just want to configure the keyboard backlight to turn off after N seconds of inactivity to reduce battery drain.
